      <title>Bayer, Kumquat Target KRAS Variant in Up-to-$1.3B+ Cancer Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://www.genengnews.com/topics/cancer/bayer-kumquat-target-kras-variant-in-up-to-1-3b-cancer-collaboration/</link>
      <summary>The collaboration comes after the FDA last month cleared Kumquat’s investigational new drug (IND) application to begin clinical trials of the KRAS G12D inhibitor. Bayer and Kumquat reason that while KRAS mutations occur in nearly 25% of human cancers, G12D is the most prevalent and oncogenic KRAS variant that still lacks effective treatment options.
